1. Introduction
Overview of the Application:
The Modular Threat Mapping Dashboard provides users with an interactive platform to explore, analyze, and visualize the MITRE ATT&CK dataset.
The dashboard features five key modules: Top Techniques, Software Usage, Adversary Group Analysis, Relationship Analysis, and Combined Techniques, Groups, and Tactics.
Purpose:
This manual explains how to navigate the application, interact with the different modules, and export visualizations for further analysis or reporting.
System Requirements:
Python version 3.7+
Required libraries: pandas, plotly, streamlit
Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
2. Getting Started
How to Launch the Application:
  1. Clone the Github Respository :
     git clone https://github.com/team/project
  2. Navigate to the project directory:
     cd project-directory
  3. Install requirement library :
     pip install plotly
     pip install streamlit
     pip install pandas
     pip install -U kaleido
  4. Run the application using Streamlit:
     streamlit run app.py
  5. It will antomatically open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to view the dashboard.
3. Navigating the Dashboard
      1. Main Interface Overview:
          The dashboard is divided into the following sections:
          Sidebar: Used for navigation and filtering options.
          Main Display Area: Displays visualizations and charts based on the selected module.
      2. Modules:
          1. Top Techniques:
            Displays the top 10 techniques used across adversary groups.
            How to interact: Use the sidebar to select the module, and the visualization will automatically display. You can hover over the bars for more information or zoom into specific sections.
            Export option: Click the "Download as PDF" button to export the visualization.
          2. Software Usage:
            Shows the top 10 software used across techniques.
            How to interact: After selecting the module, a bar chart will appear. You can hover and zoom in/out.
            Export option: Click "Download as PDF" to save the chart.
          3. Adversary Group Analysis:
            Displays the top 10 most active adversary groups using different techniques.
            How to interact: Use the sidebar to choose this module, and the bar chart will update.
            Export option: Use the "Download as PDF" option for export.
          4. Relationship Analysis:
            Allows users to select techniques and visualize relationships between techniques, tactics, and software.
            How to interact:
            Use the multiselect dropdown to choose techniques from the sidebar.
            A stacked bar chart, a regular bar chart, and a treemap visualization will be displayed.
            Export options: You can export each visualization by clicking the respective download buttons.
          5. Combined Techniques, Groups, and Tactics:
            Combines data from techniques, adversary groups, and tactics for analysis.
            How to interact: Use the multiselect dropdown to filter specific adversary groups. A bar chart will display techniques used by selected groups.
            Export option: Click "Download as PDF" to save the chart.
4. Exporting Visualizations
  How to Export Data:
    Each visualization in the dashboard can be exported as a PDF.
  Steps:
    Once you generate a chart, click on the "Download as PDF" button below the visualization.
    The file will download directly to your device.
  Use Cases:
    Exported charts can be used in reports or presentations to share insights on cyber adversary behavior.
5. Troubleshooting
  Common Issues:
    Application not running: Ensure you have installed all the required dependencies.
    Visualization not updating: Try refreshing the page or re-selecting the filter options.
    PDF not downloading: Make sure your browser allows downloads from the application and try re-clicking the button.
